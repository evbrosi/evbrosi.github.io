        <h2>EAGLE VALIANT BROSI</h2>

        <p>I make comics, zines, and graphic novels.</p>

        <p>
          My debut graphic novel, <em>Black Cohosh</em>, is a LA Times Book Award Finalist.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eagle Valiant Brosi was raised in an unconventional, back-to-the-land hippie lifestyle
          in the Appalachian foothills. Despite his non-traditional beginnings, Eagle conformed
          to the standard life of an American capitalist. He works from home, making a computer
          sigh and groan.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this routine, days pass by without much human interaction. His garden, however,
          provides a contrast to the quiet work life. Among rows of tomatoes, beans, zucchini,
          and summer squash, he enjoys the good company of slugs, mosquitoes, and bumblebees.
          If he closes his eyes hard enough, he forgets about the life he was supposed to lead
          and who he was supposed to be.
        </p>

        <h4>This is my website.</h4>

        <p>
          There's so much more to me than just this website! I'm the youngest of seven kids.
          I make my own pickles, sauerkraut, and pie crusts. Yes, my parents really did name
          me Eagle Valiant.

          People want to put you in a box. They believe you need nav bars, hamburger menus,
          and all the other bells and whistles. I think I can tell you about myself with just
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
          Try mousing over an image if you're using your mamaw's computer—or just tap a sweet
          pic on your intelligent phone.

              It feels false and needy to ask for a rating. I don't care if the rating is bad.
              What matters is for people to hear what you think.
